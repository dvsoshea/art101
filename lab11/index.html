            <p>The challenge for this lab was figuring out how to use Jquery alongside HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
        
        <h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
            <p>One problem that I ran into was figuring out how to refer to an object after it was clicked. Since I was used to using objects and variables in previous labs, it was challenging to get accustomed to the  Jquery verbiage (more specifically related to Jquery selectors) </p>
