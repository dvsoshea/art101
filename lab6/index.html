      <h1>Challenge</h1>
        <p>
           The main challenge that this lab presented was figuring out how to use and print Javascript arrays and objects to document some different modes of transportation.

    <h1>Problems</h1>
        <p>
            One problem that I ran into with this lab was figuring out how to refer to objects within Javascript and in hmtl. I had never used objects before so this was unfamiliar to me.
