        Lab 3 File Structures
    </h1>
    <p>
        The idea of this labs was to create a local file structure and add index.hmtl files

    <p>
        I was able to create a file structure and html files fairly easily however I had some trouble linking to specific stylesheets and navigating the structure within html.

        Here are the screenshots of my final file structure and html.<br><br>
