        <h1>Challenges</h1>
            <p>The challenge for lab 10 was mainly to use Html input forms to take user input through Javascript and change HTML elements/CSS. </p>
        <h1>Problems</h1>
            <p>There were many <b>many</b> problems that came up during this lab. For example, one issue that I ran into was when I tried to call the onclick function. Since the script tag is in the top of the page I had to figure out how to make the function wait until the page was loaded. That was just one problem amongst many overall. I would say this was the hardest lab so far. </p>
