            <p>Although I'm not sure if it qualifies as a problem, one issue that I consistently ran into during this lab was remembering the wording for javascript/jquery. For example, I had to look up how to split a string (from previous labs) or refer to an object in an array. I also had to look up how to get the value of an object with jquery using .val(). </p>
