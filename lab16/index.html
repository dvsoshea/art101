        <h1>Problems</h1>
            <p>
                There were several really challenging parts of this lab. The first issue that I ran into was that the xkcd link from the lab wasn't accepting my "get" request because some issue with CORS policy. To mitigate this I used @mrmartineau's <a href="https://github.com/mrmartineau/xkcd-api">xkcd API</a> from github which is CORS enabled. Another issue I ran into was figuring out how to turn the API call into a function.

        <h1>Results</h1>
            I managed to call the xkcd API and create a gallery style display with previous and next button
            <p id="output">
                <div id="buttons">
                    <button id="prev">prev</button>
                    <button id="next">next</button>
                </div>
            </p>
